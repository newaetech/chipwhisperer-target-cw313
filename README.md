# ChipWhisperer CW313 - 20-Pin to Card Edge (CW312 Style) Breakout/Adapter Board

The CW313 board is part of a standard ChipWhisperer-Husky build-out. It contains some of the
functionality of the original CW308 board, but at a much lower price-point. It also uses the
cost-optimized CW312 card edge connector.
